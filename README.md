# Patch-Tuesday-CSVs  
This is a list of Microsoft's Patch Tuesday updates, in handy CSV format!  
  
# Format
The format of the CSV is as follows:  
Release date	| Last Updated | CVE Number | CVE Title | CVE Link | MRSC Link | Impact |	Max Severity | Tag | Vector String | Mitigations | Workarounds

# To-Do  
[ ] Create CSV automatically  
[ ] Strip HTML formatting from CSV  
[ ] Add CVSS score  
  
# Why does this look like the MSRC list?  
That's because it mostly is! I have added a few things; otherwise, it is a copy of that data.
